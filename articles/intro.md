## Tech Drive 2017 - VJTI,Mumbai (March 2017) by Omkar Dusane:

We started this workshop with a new methodology to teach. Call it an experiment. (Results are very good, Students are learning very fast)

Hi, reader of this doc, I will call you 'you'. 

Our world is now is very much composed of web services. May it be private services that client-applications of companies like Uber and Ola use or Backends of facebook and twitter.
So I am giving you a problem statement and some tools to build solutions as web services. 
Remember You will be the one solving the problem. I am just introducing you to the tools and giving you the problem statement. Please use your creativity and all the freedom on the internet to get help and make sure at the end you tell me "I know these tools and I know how to use them to solve real world problems"
